# Capstone Project: Home Credit Default
Repository containing Alex Hamil's portfolio of work for the data science project Home Credit Default.

## Business Problem Statement
Home Credit is in the business of trying to provide financial products to customers in unique and diverse markets where the traditional tenets of regulated banking aren't always present. They provide financial products and services to customers that have insufficient or nonexistent traditional credit histories and metrics used to apply for loans and other financial services. In lieu of this, they have alternative data that can be used to try to predict a customerâ€™s ability to repay loans and qualify for services.

The purpose of this project is to create a model that allows Home Credit to build an accurate credit risk profile of their customers based on nontraditional financial data.
